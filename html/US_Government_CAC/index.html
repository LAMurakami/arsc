<h1> <span id="Introduction."> Introduction. </span></h1>
<p>Most if not all US Government employees are now issued a CAC (Common Access Card).  This includes active members of the Armed Services and civilian government employees.  Many government contractors may also be issued a CAC.
</p><p>The CAC serves as an identification card that humans can read and includes a picture, expiration date, and ID number.  The CAC is also a Smart Card that can be read to access government signed certificates stored on the CAC.  Reading the CAC requires entry of a Personal Identification Number (PIN).  The combination of the CAC (something you have) and the PIN (something you know) for authentication is a form of Two factor Authentication which is a requirement to access many U.S. Government (USG) Information Systems (IS) and the preffered way for many more.
</p>
<h1> <span id="64-bit-Linux"> 64 bit Linux machine </span></h1>
<p>Getting a US Government CAC to work on a 64 bit REHL 6.4 machine or a 64 bit CentOS 6.4 machine running the x86_64 version of Firefox is a lot easier than getting a CAC to work on Linux was in the past.  The US Government mostly uses MS Windows workstations and offers little or no official support for using a CAC on another platform.
</p><p>This procedure has been used on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.4 machines and CentOS 6.4 machines and should also work on Scientific Linux (SL) 6.4 machines.
</p>
<ul><li> Card: "Oberthur ID One V5.5 Dual"
</li><li> Reader: <a href="SCR331.pdf" rel="nofollow">SCR-331</a>
</li></ul>
<p>Install esc (Enterprise Security Client Smart Card Client) which will
cause the ccid, coolkey, pcsc-lite, and pcsc-lite-libs dependancies to be installed.
</p>
<pre>yum -y install esc
</pre>
<p>Update xulrunner which updates firefox.
</p>
<pre>yum -y update xulrunner
</pre>
<p>Reboot
</p><p>At this point the "Smart Card Manager" can see information on the CAC card.

<h2> <span id="Configure_the_.22CAC_Reader.22_Security_Device_in_the_x86_64_version_of_Firefox:"> Configure the "CAC Reader" Security Device in the x86_64 version of Firefox: </span></h2>
<p>Select "Preferences" from the "Edit" menu.
Click on the "Advanced" icon and then select the "Encryption" tab.
</p><p>Click on the "Security Devices" button and then the "Load" button in the window that appears.
Under "Module Name" put a name you will recognize such as "CAC Reader".
</p><p>Click the browse button and navigate to /usr/lib64/pkcs11/libcoolkeypk11.so and select that, or, alternatively, enter "/usr/lib64/pkcs11/libcoolkeypk11.so" in the "Module Filename" field.
</p><p>The "CAC Reader" module will now appear in the previous window, and, if you have a CAC Reader plugged into the computer with a CAC inserted, your personal information will appear as well.
</p><p>Once you are at this point you can now visit DoD CAC enabled sites.
</p>
<h2> <span id="Add_exceptions_to_trust_DoD_sites_you_will_use_your_CAC_to_authenticate_to."> Add exceptions to trust DoD sites you will use your CAC to authenticate to. </span></h2>
<p>You could install DoD root certificates but then you would have to keep updating them anyway.
</p><p>Expired certificates that have been added by exception may have to delete before you can add a new certificate for the same site.
</p><p>These appear in Firefox -&gt; Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt; View Certificates -&gt; Servers
</p>
<ul><li> Scroll down to see the DoD sites under "U.S. Government".
</li><li> Look at the "Expires On" column and delete any that have a date in the past.
</li></ul>

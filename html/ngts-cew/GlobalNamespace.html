<h3>CEW recommends the following for the Global Namespace</h3>

<h4>user namespace</h4>

/archive/&lt;srb_user&gt;/&lt;site&gt;/<span class="purple">&lt;filesystem&gt;</span>

<h4>resource namespace</h4>

/&lt;site&gt;/&lt;filesystem&gt;/<span class="purple">&lt;user&gt;</span>

<h4>Global Namespace</h4>

<p>The global namespace includes a fully qualified path for all objects known to the Storage Resource Broker (SRB).
The resource namespace is designed to allow for all objects on the HPCMP archive filesystems to be ingested or registered into SRB with no name collisions.  The user namespace provides a tree view of all of a user's objects known to SRB on all resources.

<h4>Use of symbolic links</h4>

<p>The filessytem within the site collection of a user's space is a symbolic link to the user directory within the initial ingestion space of the Global Namespace.

<p>It is prefferred that the symbolic link will be created for the user at the time of granting access to the resource.

<p>Note that the recursive option of the SRB listing command (Sls) does not traverse symbolic links.

<h4>Filesystem portion of collection path</h4>

<p>With the inclusion of the Center Wide File System, all sites will have multiple filesystems.

<dt>April 2010 - LAM - Initial version posted to NGTS portal

<dd><ul><li>This is from discussion at the March 2011, Preliminary Detailed Design Specification (DDS) Review in San Diego, California.  Much of the discussion was on the first day was in a hotel conference room where the Customer Experience Workgroup (CEW) had a face to face meeting.
<li>Steve Scherr was one of the main advocates of users being in a different default collection at each site they logged into.
<li>Additional discussions occurred later in the week with the larger SLM group
<li>The larger SLM group also recommended that an Sinit wrapper be created that includes setting the current collection for a user to the site folder.
</ul>

<dt>May 2011 - LAM - Revisions based on 5/9/2011 CEW conference call and earlier emails.
<dd><ul><li>Added Revision log section to the document.  Moved notes into the revision log.
<li>Last year the CEW dropped the idea of an Sinit wrapper in favor of <a href="SRB-Initialization.html">SRB Initialization</a> performed by the system upon login.  This was not implemented for the ARL Pioneer phase leading to additional discussion on the topic and some changes.
<li>CEW removed optional from the filesystem portion of the collection path.  The Center Wide File System will be available at every site.  To prepare for the future when automatic registration of objects into the SRB the a cwfs subcollection is reserved for each site.  This means that every site has multiple filesystems where objects may be ingested or registered.
<li>Additional concern had been voiced over sites having different levels of parent collections above the default initial collection where a user would ingest (Sput) objects by default.  Making the filesystem portion of the collection namespace not be optional makes the collection depth to the default initial collection the same for all sites.
<li>Removed brackets indicating optional from collection path's.
<li>Changed sentence about creation of symbolic links to say "at the time of granting access to the resource" instead of "at the time of initial ingestion".
<li>Changed "initial ingestion space" to "resource namespace"
<li>Added Global Namespace section with sentance stating the no name collisions concern.

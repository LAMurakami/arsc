.SH DESCRIPTION

is the command line interface to set a "Retention Period" on Storage Resource Broker (SRB) objects.
The Sretain command updates the "Admin Scheme" which is a System Scheme that is automatically
applied during ingestion of objects into SRB.
The Sretain command requires a days or date argument for the retention period and objects
or collections to act upon.
The "Last Review Time" is set automatically by the Sretain command.
.SH <days>|<date>
The [<days>|<date>] parameter is a required parameter. The [days|date] parameter determines the new
"Retention Period" to be set on Storage Resource Broker (SRB) objects.
The [<days>|<date>] parameter can be specified in a variety of formats.
.TP
[\fBbare integer\fP]
Specifies "Retention Period" in integer days of duration from the current date.
.TP
[\fBinteger\fP]\fBd\fP
Specifies "Retention Period" in integer days of duration from the current date.
.TP
[\fBinteger\fP]\fBw\fP
Specifies "Retention Period" in integer weeks of duration from the current date.
.TP
[\fBinteger\fP]\fBm\fP
Specifies "Retention Period" in integer months of duration from the current date.
.TP
[\fBinteger\fP]\fBy\fP
Specifies "Retention Period" in integer years of duration from the current date.

.SH <objects>|<collections>
The [<objects>|<collections>] parameter is a required parameter.
More than one object and/or collection can be specified.
The [<objects>|<collections>] parameter specifies the SRB objects and/or collections to act upon.
.SH OPTIONS
The Sretain command allows a number of options to set "Admin Scheme" attributes
besides the "Retention Period" and includes the -r option which causes the attributes
to be set recursively on objects within the collection[s].
The -r option can be specifed to have the command apply recursively to objects
within the specified collection or collections. 
.TP
.B
-archive|-immediate|-noarchive
Specifies whether the object is archived, archived immediately, or not archived ("Archive Behavior" attribute).
.TP
.B
-dr|-nodr
Specifies whether the object is sent to the DR system ("DR Behavior" attribute).
.TP
.B
-purge|-nopurge
Specifies whether the object is released after archive. ("Purge Behavior" attribute).
.TP
.B
-r
Specifies that the operation be applied recursively on objects within the collection[s].
The -r option only works when collections are specified.
.TP
.B
-p [HPCMP Project ID]
Specifies the 13 character HPCMP Project this object is associated with.
.SH ADMIN SCHEME
The admin scheme is a System Scheme that is automatically applied during ingestion of objects into SRB.
The admin scheme has the following attributes:
.TP
.B
Archive Behavior
Specifies whether the object is archived, archived immediately, or not archived.
.TP
.B
DR Behavior
Specifies whether the object is sent to the DR system.
.TP
.B
Purge Behavior
Specifies whether the object is released after archive.
.TP
.B
Retention Period
Identifies the number of days the object is retained in the archive.
.TP
.B
Retain-Through
Identifies the date the object is retained through in the archive.
.TP
.B
Pre-Warning period
Identifies the number of days prior to the end of the retention period that the user should be warned.
.TP
.B
Last Review
Identifies when the object was last reviewed. Automatically updated by Sretain.
.TP
.B
Next Review
Identifies when the archive policy is due to be reviewed by the user.
.TP
.B
Admin Hold
Identifies whether the object is prevented from expiration and purge
 (not user modifiable).
.TP
.B
HPCMP Project ID
Specifies the 13 character HPCMP Project this object is associated with. 
.SH Metadata Attribute Population Algorithm - Step Description
.IP 1
If the attribute is a string list then the value must be
one of the strings specified for the string list.
.IP 2
The system uses values supplied directly by the user
.IP 3
If the user does not supply a value, i.e. the value is
"null", then the system uses the user default value
associated with the attribute column.
.IP 4
If there is no user default value, the system inherits
the value from the Parent Collection.
.IP 5
If there is no Parent Collection value, the system uses
the administrator default value associated with the attribute column.
.IP 6
If none of the above conditions are met then the system
leaves the value as "null".
.P
From SRB User guide (2010 Alpha version)

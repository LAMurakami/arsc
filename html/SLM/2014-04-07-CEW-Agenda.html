<ul><li> SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final was installed on the NAVY SLM instance servers and agents the week of 2/21/2014.
<ul><li> On 3/12/2014 SLM Clients on Kilrain, Haise and NAVY Utility Server were upgraded to the SRB 2012 R3 SP5 1/7/2014 version on the Utility Server, Kilrain and Haise at NAVY.(CCAC #159129 on Kilrain, CCAC #159130 on Haise , CCAC #159128 on Utility Server at NAVY)
</li><li> <b>As of 3/10/2014 SLM at AFRL &amp; ERDC not yet at the SRB 2012 R3 SP5 1/7/2014 version.</b>
</li></ul>
</li><li> SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final was made available Wednesday 1/8/2014 (labeled build 1/7/2014)
<ul><li> This release is installed on the HTL and ARL SLM instances.
</li><li> The documentation at the public location has been upgraded to this release:
<ul><li> <a href="http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM</a>
</li><li> The centers documentation page points to this documentation:
</li><li> <a href="http://centers.hpc.mil/users/documentation.html" rel="nofollow">http://centers.hpc.mil/users/documentation.html</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> A quick test of the release was performed and passed except archiving of DR copies (an ARL issue and not a SLM issue)
</li></ul>
</li><li> SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final includes:
<ul><li> The fix for <a href="https://www.nirvanaware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2115" rel="nofollow">Bug 2115</a> - Ssync real-time latency increases on NAVYC file systems is included.
</li><li> Enhancement to allow pattern match in a policy argument.
</li><li> Sput that matches what Ssync currently allows in names (rejects asterisk)
</li><li> Fix that allows user with same name as group in a group.
</li><li> Fix race condition between Srm and Ssync that affected large recursive Srm operations.
</li></ul>
</li><li> SRB 2014 is scheduled to be released 2014 Q3.  No further releases of SRB 2012 are expected before this.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id=".24.7BSAMPLES_HOME.7D.2Fslm"> ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm </span></h2>
<ul><li> During the week of 3/31/2014 Paul completed an initial survey of ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm files.  Several obsolete and unneeded objects were deleted.
</li><li> On 3/17/2014 Paul stated that he has write access to ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm on all the Utility Servers except at HTL.
</li><li> On 2/20/2014 ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/bad-files was made available on pershing.
</li><li> On 2/4/2014 ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/siauth.pbs was upgraded for the new module on pershing, harold and the ARL Utility Servers.
<ul><li> On 1/27/2014 John Skinner had reported an issue with this script.
</li><li> On 2/3/2014 in the CEW call John suggested that the -l option for the bash bang line might help get to a single version of the script that works on all the ARL machines.  This did work and the new version also omits the "#PBS -V" directive to copy the submitting job's environment to the PBS job.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 1/13/2014 Paul Bennet asked about ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm and stated that he has access to ERDC ${SAMPLES_HOME}.
<ul><li> Lawrence stated that the ARL systems have ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm files and scripts and is probably the best copy but would have to review.
</li><li> The updated slm module which made the initialization scripts obsolete require changes to documentation and scripts that hasn't been completed yet.
</li><li> The focus now is on implementing SLM in production 'behind the scenes' and the ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm files and scripts will not be needed until the SLM client is being used.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="File_Names_and_Types_supported_on_the_archive_systems"> File Names and Types supported on the archive systems </span></h2>
<ul><li> On 4/2/2014 content for a notification to all users was posted to: <a href="http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM/CCAC-SLM-Letter.docx" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM/CCAC-SLM-Letter.docx</a>
<ul><li> Lawrence asked all CEW members to review the document for discussion on Monday.
</li><li> Tracey Smith reported that the program office must approve emails to all users which often takes more than a day.
</li><li> Michelle McDaniel reported the approval is by Cathy McDonald as part of CCACs normal process (you don't need to worry about doing anything about getting approval, unless any changes need to be made then we'd make you aware... almost never happens), but it may take a couple of days to complete
</li><li> Paul suggested an additional change that John concurred with.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Multiple versions of this document were published the week of 3/17/2014 to the SLM Documentation index at: <a href="http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM</a>
<ul><li> CEW members were asked to review the document.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 1/33/2014 Paul began facilitating getting the document "published" on a HPCMP website.
<ul><li> On 2/13/2014 Paul converted the document to word so that the web team (Glen Browning, Greg Brewer and Rick Lightfoot) could review it and turn it back into a html document.
</li><li> During the week of 3/3/2014 the document was published for review at: <a href="https://devcenters.arl.hpc.mil/users/supportedFileNames.html" rel="nofollow">https://devcenters.arl.hpc.mil/users/supportedFileNames.html</a>
</li><li> This document is based on discussion that took place in June of 2012.  In September of 2013 Tom Kendall requested the CEW create the document to become HPCMP policy on "File names and types supported on the archive systems"
</li></ul>
</li><li> In October of 2013 the "File Names and Types supported on the archive systems" document was approved by HEUE SLM management and presented to the BCT.
</li><li> ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/bad-files # On the us, pershing  and harold at ARL
<ul><li> Script that reports bad file names and types
<ul><li> The script currently reports files with embedded spaces in the name which are technically allowed although bad practice.
</li><li> The current version of the script does a find twice and should be updated to perform the find only once since some users have a large number of files and those would would experience a significantly shorter run time with the update.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 11/18/2013 Lawrence stated we need do decide: <b>When do we want CCAC to do the notification?</b>
<ul><li> On 1/13/2014 the consensus was that notification should go out as soon as reasonably possible.
</li><li> This affects the initial ingestion and SRB in production 'behind the scenes' and is not something that should wait until the SLM client is being used.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">James will make the update previously mentioned in an email dialog.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Lawrence will post the updated document.</span>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <span class="green1">Paul will attempt to get the webpage on devcenters on to the centers website.</span>
</li><li> <span class="green1">If this is not in place by next week we will request the email anyway.</span>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="HPCMP_BCT_Common_Set_of_Environment_Variables_policy"> HPCMP BCT Common Set of Environment Variables policy </span></h2>
<ul><li> The following statement is repeated in the ARCHIVE_HOST and ARCHIVE_HOME sections in HPCMP BCT Common Set of Environment Variables policy should be corrected or removed:
<ul><li> Note this environment variable becomes unnecessary and should be undefined once Storage Lifecycle Management (SLM) goes into production at a center.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The repeated statement in the ARCHIVE_HOST and ARCHIVE_HOME sections should/could read:
<ul><li> Note the definition and use of this environment variable will change once Storage Lifecycle Management (SLM) goes into production at a center.
</li><li> The combination of the unique values of ARCHIVE_HOME and ARCHIVE_HOST can be used to determine the default resource and location of an individual user's directory on the archival file system that serves a given compute platform. Although the access means will change each individual user will still have a directory on the archival file system that serves a given compute platform.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 12/16/2013 Lawrence stated that we want Don Cable to take this to the BCT.
<ul><li> Now that we have the slm module  using the ARCHIVE_HOME environment variable we show a clear need for a change of the "this environment variable becomes unnecessary" statement.
</li></ul>
</li><li> A module to "properly" set ARCHIVE_HOME at NAVY was created and installed ant NAVY to be loaded prior to the slm module.
<ul><li> NAVY sets ARCHIVE_HOME to HOME (/u/home/${USER}) for all users by default.
</li><li> Setting ARCHIVE_HOME to /u/g/${USER} or /u/b/${USER} appropriately does not interfere with with any use of the ARCHIVE_HOME environment variable since users can use either the automounted HOME or the actual file-system directory.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 1/13/2014 Don acknowledged that Lawrence wants the "this environment variable becomes unnecessary" statement removed from the HPCMP BCT Common Set of Environment Variables policy.
</li><li> On 1/27/2014 and 2/3/2014 Don reported no status change on this item.
</li><li> On 3/24/2014 Don stated that he will talk to the BCT about this.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="CUAM_group_to_distribute_SLM_User_including_Preferred_IDs_and_Storage_Realm_credentials."> CUAM group to distribute SLM User including Preferred IDs and Storage Realm credentials. </span></h2>
<ul><li> On 3/18/2014 Mike Knowles reported that he is waiting on navo to finalize the Preferred IDs method of transfer.
<ul><li> Once Preferred IDs method of transfer has been finalized we will implement Storage Realm credentials distribution using same method to hpc hosts.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Mike Knowles gave a 3/3/2014 date which includes Storage Realm credentials (reported in 1/13/2014 SLM Management call).
<ul><li> SLM management will request an earlier date for the Preferred IDs portion required for SRB in production 'behind the scenes'.
</li><li> This is not an integrated part of CUAM.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The kerberos keytab overlap feature is not being addressed by this effort.
</li></ul>

<h2> <span id="Recent_Topics"> Recent Topics </span></h2>
<ul><li> On 3/13/2014 The archive_home module was installed on the Utility Server, Kilrain and Haise at NAVY.
<ul><li> See: <a href="https://staffportal.arsc.edu/WO/ContractWork/HEUE/Customer_Experience_Workgroup/ngts-cew/2014-03-17-CEW-Agenda.html#.24.7BARCHIVE_HOME.7D_on_NAVY_systems" rel="nofollow">3/17/2014 CEW Agenda &amp; Call Notes</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> A new slm module allows cross site authentication.  The ARCHIVE_HOME environment variable controls which resource is used as the default.
<ul><li> NAVY users must load the new archive_home module prior to using the new slm module for the correct resource to be set as the default.
</li><li> This new module was put in place on ARL systems in December of 2013 and on NAVY systems in March of 2014.  It will be put in place at other DSRCs when as part of the SLM Client install.
</li><li> See: <a href="https://staffportal.arsc.edu/WO/ContractWork/HEUE/Customer_Experience_Workgroup/ngts-cew/2014-03-17-CEW-Agenda.html#New_slm_module_allows_cross_site_authentication" rel="nofollow">3/17/2014 CEW Agenda &amp; Call Notes</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> Dual SLM and NFS access to archive on HTL US
<ul><li> See: <a href="https://staffportal.arsc.edu/WO/ContractWork/HEUE/Customer_Experience_Workgroup/ngts-cew/2014-02-10-CEW-Agenda.html#Dual_SLM_and_NFS_access_to_archive_on_HTL_US" rel="nofollow">2/10/2014 CEW Agenda &amp; Call Notes</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> The ARL (mcat2x) / MHPCC (mcat5x) / HTL (mcat7x) mcats were not operational on 10/14/2013 due to routing problems introduced in the ARL network during maintenance.
</li><li> On 10/17/2013 Management clarified short file-system names without server are to be used for Slinks and resource namespace.
<ul><li> See Email from Tom Kendall with subject: RE: Policy Decision: Collection names underneath (UNCLASSIFIED)
</li></ul>
</li><li> The <a href="https://staffportal.arsc.edu/WO/ContractWork/HEUE/Customer_Experience_Workgroup/ngts-cew/Policy/Tab/CWFS_Scrubber_policy.html" rel="nofollow">CWFS Scrubber policy</a> is on Centport.
<ul><li> The CWFS Scrubber Policy basically says modify time only will be used because access time is not updated on the Panasus files systems.  It says this for both ${WORKDIR} and ${CENTER}.
</li><li> The fact that access time is not updated on the Panasus files systems was discussed in the CWFS call on 11/7/2013.  Recent work on ${CENTER} scrubbing may not have taken this into consideration.
</li><li> On November 7, 2013 The ${WORKDIR} time was increased from 10 days to 15 days based on 1/12/2012 Change to BCT Policy.
</li></ul>
</li><li> As of  October 2013 the siauth command that enables PBS transfer queue jobs to authenticate into the STORAGE.HPC.MIL kerberos realm for access to Storage Lifecycle Management has been installed and is functional on the Utility Server, pershing and harold at ARL.
<ul><li> The ticket granting ticket has been tested to work with SLM.
</li><li> Only a limited set of user keytabs are currently installed.
</li><li> This functionality will be available to all users once the automated distribution of user keytabs for the STORAGE.HPC.MIL kerberos realm has been implemented.
</li><li> A ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/siauth.pbs script has been created on the ARL systems to provide an example of a PBS job using this functionality.
</li><li> The the Utility Server harold and pershing versions are slightly different due to differences in configuration and initialization of PBS jobs on the systems.
</li><li> The sample script has verbose comments and includes some extra output Lawrence thinks is appropriate for sample script.
</li></ul>

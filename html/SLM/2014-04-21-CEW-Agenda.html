<ul><li> Current core members of the Customer Experience Workgroup (CEW) are: Lawrence A. Murakami (HTL), John Skinner (NAVO), Don Cable (AFRL), Mary Ann Ciufini (MHPCC), James (Jim) Duke (GA), James Ianni (ARL), Paul Bennett (ERDC)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Christopher Barnes states that he has a conflicting call related to additional management duties but is following CEW meeting notes.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">On the Call: Lawrence A. Murakami (HTL), Don Cable (AFRL), James Ianni (ARL), Paul Bennett (ERDC), Martin W Margo (GA), James (Jim) Duke (GA), Mary Ann Ciufini (MHPCC), Reid D. Bingham (GA)</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Reid says: Since August 2009 it has been challenging and entertaining.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Mary Ann asked: What will happen with the equipment?</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Mary Ann asked: Did the DSRCs pay for the equipment?</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Reid stated that the equipment and the first year of service was paid by the program office.  Additional years of service was paid from the funds allocated to DSRCs.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">No decision has been made on the final disposition of the equipment.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Lawrence stated he has tentatively scheduled a call for two weeks from now in case there is further information on the winding down of the project.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <span class="green1">Lawrence stated that the memorandum does not state that SLM has to be removed from the HTL machines since they are neither production or allocated machines.</span>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="SLM_Project_to_be_discontinued"> SLM Project to be discontinued </span></h2>
<ul><li> On Friday April 18, 2014, John West issued a Memorandum For Record (MFR) stating the Storage Lifecycle Management project is discontinued.  SLM software is to be removed from production use on any allocated HPCMP machines.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="SLM_Management_Review"> SLM Management Review </span></h2>
<ul><li> On Friday, 11 April, 2014 there was a review of SLM at the John West level of the HPCMP.
</li><li> Management did not decide anything during the review.  We're told to expect word on their preferred direction for SLM by end of week.
</li><li> Tom Kendall reported the presentation, which several contributed to, went well and management appreciated the thorough slides.
</li><li> On 4/14/2014 Mary Ann reported on questions that had been sent to Center Directors after the SLM Management Review from Christine Cuicchi:
<ul><li> What is your center's current experience with the SLM project and its team members?
</li><li> Do you feel that the current path of SLM is appropriate?  Why or why not?
</li><li> Have your center's technical personnel been involved in the SLM project?  What are their perceptions of SLM/SRB in terms of programming and build practices, project management, etc.?
</li><li> Have your center's users or CCAC liaisons been exposed to the SLM pilot or the SRB product?  What are their experiences?  If they have not been exposed, was it due to lack of interest or lack of knowledge of SLM pilot and/or training events?
</li><li> What is your opinion on continuing or discontinuing the SLM product?
</li><li> Please add any additional information, opinions, thoughts, concerns you want to convey.  I've attached the slides we discussed today for additional information.  If you have any questions, please let me know.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="SRB_in_production_.27behind_the_scenes.27"> SRB in production 'behind the scenes' </span></h2>
<ul><li> HTL - SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final was installed in January and HTL is in production behind the scenes.

<h2> <span id="Recent_and_Upcoming_SRB_releases"> Recent and Upcoming SRB releases </span></h2>
<ul><li> SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final was installed on the NAVY SLM instance servers and agents the week of 2/21/2014.
<ul><li> On 3/12/2014 SLM Clients on Kilrain, Haise and NAVY Utility Server were upgraded to the SRB 2012 R3 SP5 1/7/2014 version on the Utility Server, Kilrain and Haise at NAVY.(CCAC #159129 on Kilrain, CCAC #159130 on Haise , CCAC #159128 on Utility Server at NAVY)
</li><li> <b>As of 3/10/2014 SLM at AFRL &amp; ERDC not yet at the SRB 2012 R3 SP5 1/7/2014 version.</b>
</li></ul>
</li><li> SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final was made available Wednesday 1/8/2014 (labeled build 1/7/2014)
<ul><li> This release is installed on the HTL and ARL SLM instances.
</li><li> The documentation at the public location has been upgraded to this release:
<ul><li> <a href="." rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM</a>
</li><li> The centers documentation page points to this documentation:
</li><li> <a href="http://centers.hpc.mil/users/documentation.html" rel="nofollow">http://centers.hpc.mil/users/documentation.html</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> A quick test of the release was performed and passed except archiving of DR copies (an ARL issue and not a SLM issue)
</li></ul>
</li><li> SRB 2012 R3 SP5 Final includes:
<ul><li> The fix for <a href="https://www.nirvanaware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2115" rel="nofollow">Bug 2115</a> - Ssync real-time latency increases on NAVYC file systems is included.
</li><li> Enhancement to allow pattern match in a policy argument.
</li><li> Sput that matches what Ssync currently allows in names (rejects asterisk)
</li><li> Fix that allows user with same name as group in a group.
</li><li> Fix race condition between Srm and Ssync that affected large recursive Srm operations.
</li></ul>
</li><li> SRB 2014 is scheduled to be released 2014 Q3.  No further releases of SRB 2012 are expected before this.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id=".24.7BSAMPLES_HOME.7D.2Fslm"> ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm </span></h2>
<ul><li> During the week of 3/31/2014 Paul completed an initial survey of ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm files.  Several obsolete and unneeded objects were deleted.
</li><li> On 3/17/2014 Paul stated that he has write access to ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm on all the Utility Servers except at HTL.
</li><li> On 2/20/2014 ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/bad-files was made available on pershing.
</li><li> On 2/4/2014 ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/siauth.pbs was upgraded for the new module on pershing, harold and the ARL Utility Servers.
<ul><li> On 1/27/2014 John Skinner had reported an issue with this script.
</li><li> On 2/3/2014 in the CEW call John suggested that the -l option for the bash bang line might help get to a single version of the script that works on all the ARL machines.  This did work and the new version also omits the "#PBS -V" directive to copy the submitting job's environment to the PBS job.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 1/13/2014 Paul Bennet asked about ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm and stated that he has access to ERDC ${SAMPLES_HOME}.
<ul><li> Lawrence stated that the ARL systems have ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm files and scripts and is probably the best copy but would have to review.
</li><li> The updated slm module which made the initialization scripts obsolete require changes to documentation and scripts that hasn't been completed yet.
</li><li> The focus now is on implementing SLM in production 'behind the scenes' and the ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm files and scripts will not be needed until the SLM client is being used.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="File_Names_and_Types_supported_on_the_archive_systems"> File Names and Types supported on the archive systems </span></h2>
<ul><li> On 4/15/2014 James submitted CCAC Livetime request #160853 to have the "File Names and Types supported" letter to be distributed to all DSRC users.
</li><li> On 4/8/2014 Updated content for a notification to all users was posted to: <a href="CCAC-SLM-Letter.docx" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM/CCAC-SLM-Letter.docx</a>
</li><li> On 4/7/2014 CEW discussed the 4/2/2014 version and a slight change was made.  If the html document has been posted from devcenters.hpc.mil to centers.hpc.mil the notification content will be updated with the new URL.  In either case James will request this email be sent out next week.
</li><li> On 4/2/2014 content for a notification to all users was posted to: <a href="CCAC-SLM-Letter.docx" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM/CCAC-SLM-Letter.docx</a>
<ul><li> Tracey Smith reported that the program office must approve emails to all users which often takes more than a day.
</li><li> Michelle McDaniel reported the approval is by Cathy McDonald as part of CCACs normal process (you don't need to worry about doing anything about getting approval, unless any changes need to be made then we'd make you aware... almost never happens), but it may take a couple of days to complete
</li><li> Paul suggested an additional change that John concurred with.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Multiple versions of this document were published the week of 3/17/2014 to the SLM Documentation index at: <a href="." rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM</a>
<ul><li> CEW members were asked to review the document.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 1/33/2014 Paul began facilitating getting the document "published" on a HPCMP website.
<ul><li> On 2/13/2014 Paul converted the document to word so that the web team (Glen Browning, Greg Brewer and Rick Lightfoot) could review it and turn it back into a html document.
</li><li> During the week of 3/3/2014 the document was published for review at: <a href="https://devcenters.arl.hpc.mil/users/supportedFileNames.html" rel="nofollow">https://devcenters.arl.hpc.mil/users/supportedFileNames.html</a>
</li><li> This document is based on discussion that took place in June of 2012.  In September of 2013 Tom Kendall requested the CEW create the document to become HPCMP policy on "File names and types supported on the archive systems"
</li></ul>
</li><li> In October of 2013 the "File Names and Types supported on the archive systems" document was approved by HEUE SLM management and presented to the BCT.
</li><li> ${SAMPLES_HOME}/slm/bad-files # On the us, pershing  and harold at ARL
<ul><li> Script that reports bad file names and types
<ul><li> The script currently reports files with embedded spaces in the name which are technically allowed although bad practice.
</li><li> The current version of the script does a find twice and should be updated to perform the find only once since some users have a large number of files and those would would experience a significantly shorter run time with the update.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 11/18/2013 Lawrence stated we need do decide: <b>When do we want CCAC to do the notification?</b>
<ul><li> On 1/13/2014 the consensus was that notification should go out as soon as reasonably possible.
</li><li> This affects the initial ingestion and SRB in production 'behind the scenes' and is not something that should wait until the SLM client is being used.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="HPCMP_BCT_Common_Set_of_Environment_Variables_policy"> HPCMP BCT Common Set of Environment Variables policy </span></h2>
<ul><li> The following statement is repeated in the ARCHIVE_HOST and ARCHIVE_HOME sections in HPCMP BCT Common Set of Environment Variables policy should be corrected or removed:
<ul><li> Note this environment variable becomes unnecessary and should be undefined once Storage Lifecycle Management (SLM) goes into production at a center.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The repeated statement in the ARCHIVE_HOST and ARCHIVE_HOME sections should/could read:
<ul><li> Note the definition and use of this environment variable will change once Storage Lifecycle Management (SLM) goes into production at a center.
</li><li> The combination of the unique values of ARCHIVE_HOME and ARCHIVE_HOST can be used to determine the default resource and location of an individual user's directory on the archival file system that serves a given compute platform. Although the access means will change each individual user will still have a directory on the archival file system that serves a given compute platform.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 12/16/2013 Lawrence stated that we want Don Cable to take this to the BCT.
<ul><li> Now that we have the slm module  using the ARCHIVE_HOME environment variable we show a clear need for a change of the "this environment variable becomes unnecessary" statement.
</li></ul>
</li><li> A module to "properly" set ARCHIVE_HOME at NAVY was created and installed ant NAVY to be loaded prior to the slm module.
<ul><li> NAVY sets ARCHIVE_HOME to HOME (/u/home/${USER}) for all users by default.
</li><li> Setting ARCHIVE_HOME to /u/g/${USER} or /u/b/${USER} appropriately does not interfere with with any use of the ARCHIVE_HOME environment variable since users can use either the automounted HOME or the actual file-system directory.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 1/13/2014 Don acknowledged that Lawrence wants the "this environment variable becomes unnecessary" statement removed from the HPCMP BCT Common Set of Environment Variables policy.
</li><li> On 1/27/2014 and 2/3/2014 Don reported no status change on this item.
</li><li> On 3/24/2014 Don stated that he will talk to the BCT about this.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="CUAM_group_to_distribute_SLM_User_including_Preferred_IDs_and_Storage_Realm_credentials."> CUAM group to distribute SLM User including Preferred IDs and Storage Realm credentials. </span></h2>
<ul><li> On 3/18/2014 Mike Knowles reported that he is waiting on navo to finalize the Preferred IDs method of transfer.
<ul><li> Once Preferred IDs method of transfer has been finalized we will implement Storage Realm credentials distribution using same method to hpc hosts.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Mike Knowles gave a 3/3/2014 date which includes Storage Realm credentials (reported in 1/13/2014 SLM Management call).
<ul><li> SLM management will request an earlier date for the Preferred IDs portion required for SRB in production 'behind the scenes'.
</li><li> This is not an integrated part of CUAM.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The kerberos keytab overlap feature is not being addressed by this effort.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span id="increasing_the_Storage_Realm_ticket_life_to_24_hours_to_match_transfer_queue_jobs"> increasing the Storage Realm ticket life to 24 hours to match transfer queue jobs </span></h2>
<h2> <span id="Recent_Topics"> Recent Topics </span></h2>
<ul><li> On 4/10/2014 a new version of the SLM Early Adopters Training Hands On was posted to: <a href="SLM-Early-Adopters-Training-2013-Hands-On.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM/SLM-Early-Adopters-Training-2013-Hands-On.html</a>
<ul><li> This replaces: <a href="ARL-SLM-Early-Adopters-Training-2013-Hands-On.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.arsc.edu/~murakami/SLM/ARL-SLM-Early-Adopters-Training-2013-Hands-On.html</a>
</li><li> The update replaces references to the obsolete init.sh and init.csh scripts with the updated slm module.
</li></ul>
</li><li> On 3/13/2014 The archive_home module was installed on the Utility Server, Kilrain and Haise at NAVY.
<ul><li> See: <a href="https://staffportal.arsc.edu/WO/ContractWork/HEUE/Customer_Experience_Workgroup/ngts-cew/2014-03-17-CEW-Agenda.html#.24.7BARCHIVE_HOME.7D_on_NAVY_systems" rel="nofollow">3/17/2014 CEW Agenda &amp; Call Notes</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> A new slm module allows cross site authentication.  The ARCHIVE_HOME environment variable controls which resource is used as the default.
<ul><li> NAVY users must load the new archive_home module prior to using the new slm module for the correct resource to be set as the default.
</li><li> This new module was put in place on ARL systems in December of 2013 and on NAVY systems in March of 2014.  It will be put in place at other DSRCs when as part of the SLM Client install.

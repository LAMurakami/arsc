<h2>Arctic Region Supercomputing Center does not exist!</h2>
<p>August 31, 2015 was the last day the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Region_Supercomputing_Center">Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC)</a> existed.  The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center was from 1993 to 2015 a research facility organized under the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  ARSC was a Distributed Center (DC), an Allocated Distributed Center (ADC) and then one of six DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense">Department of Defense (DoD)</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Computing_Modernization_Program">High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP)</a> from 1993 through 2011.
</p><p>ARSC hosted a variety of HPC systems many of which were listed as among the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500">Top 500</a> most powerful in the world. For more than 10 years ARSC maintained the standing of at least one system on the Top 500 list.

<p>Employees were allowed a space on the people.arsc.edu domain to post personal information.  The official policy was:
</p><p>ARSC employees were encouraged to develop creative personal web pages that express their interests, views, and tastes as well as basic biographical and job-related information.  ARSC required that pages include a link to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090902051702/http://www.arsc.edu/misc/Disclaimer.html">an official disclaimer page</a> that stated the pages represent the views of the individuals only, not the organization.
</p><p>Unofficially it was understood that pages that ARSC management didn't like would be a bad idea.

<p>The arsc.lam1.us page is a copy of what was at people.arsc.edu/~murakami with broken links changed.  Some of the links were changed to point to pages captured by The Internet Archive as part of the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.
</p><p>I started with ARSC Monday, August 31, 2009 and created the people.arsc.edu/~murakami page by the end of the year when I created an ARSC HPC Users' Newsletter contribution.
</p><p>My time with ARSC ended August 31, 2015 when I retired, not coincidentally, the same day Arctic Region Supercomputing Center ceased to exist.

<p>I am able to create a stand alone web page from a MediaWiki page using cut and paste from the source view and minimal editing.  I developed and used this process while working for ARSC and publishing hundreds of pages to HPCMP resources and people.arsc.edu/~murakami websites.
